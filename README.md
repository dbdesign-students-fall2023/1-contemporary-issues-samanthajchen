# Contemporary Issues In Data

In this document, I will be discussing two articles about concerns regarding Tiktok's data privacy and the 

## Article 1

The New York Times article [Why Countries Are Trying to Ban TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/article/tiktok-ban.html) was published on August 16, 2023, and it is about many countries concerns about the potential risks to sensitive data posed by Tiktok and the efforts to ban the app. This article states that the growing pressure to restrict Tiktok is because of the possibility that sensitive information would get to the Chinese government. Several countries have already banned Tiktok to be downloaded on official government devices. Tiktok has denied allegations and has been advocating for a proposed agreemnt to address security concerns. This article does not take a stance on whether Tiktok should be banned or not;; instead, this article provides an overview of everything that is happening.

I find it intriguing that data privacy concerns seem to be primarily directed at TikTok, while numerous other apps also engage in extensive user data tracking. It raises questions about whether the heightened scrutiny is solely due to TikTok's parent company being Chinese. Although the CEO of TikTok has unequivocally stated that the app has never shared private data with the Chinese government, certain countries continue to implement bans on government devices. This discrepancy in treatment highlights the broader geopolitical tensions that may be at play in the decision-making process. It also underscores the importance of ensuring consistent and unbiased evaluation of data privacy practices across all apps and platforms, regardless of their country of origin. While safeguarding national security is paramount, it should be done in a way that does not inadvertently target specific apps or companies based on their nationality.


## Article 2

PBS's [Why a ban on TikTok wonâ€™t solve all data privacy concerns](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/why-a-ban-on-tiktok-wont-solve-all-data-privacy-concerns) focuses on concerns about data privacy and calls for a ban of Tiktok in the US. This article highlights that the extensive data collection practices employed by TikTok is similar to those of other social media platforms and how this data is used for targeted advertising. It talks about how Tiktok's data collection practices aren't unique, but the ownership by ByteDance (a Chinese company) raises concerns due to tensions between the US and China. This article argues that even if Tiktok gets banned, there are plenty of other apps still collecting personal data. It also states that in order to make a real change is "to pass a privacy law that applies to all apps."

I completely agree with the point made in the article that merely banning one app, like TikTok, is unlikely to bring about a meaningful and impactful change in data privacy practices. While concerns about data security are valid, singling out a particular app or company doesn't address the broader issue effectively. The fact that TikTok is owned by ByteDance has raised questions about the safety of private data, but it's essential to recognize that data collection practices are widespread across the tech industry. To truly address data privacy concerns, there is a pressing need for comprehensive legislation that applies to all apps and platforms. Such legislation should establish clear guidelines and regulations for data collection, storage, and usage across the digital landscape. This approach would not only promote a more equitable and consistent framework for data privacy but also hold all companies accountable for safeguarding user information.
